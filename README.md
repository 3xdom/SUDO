# SUDO
Order bash to do things by shouting.

## How-to

Typing `sudo chmod +x foo.sh` is so boring, isn't it? You really want to `chmod` that file, so let bash know about it. Be assertive:

	CHMOD +x foo.sh

That way, bash knows you mean business. Plus, you save yourself two keypresses if you use caps lock, or three(!) if you use shift.

## Installation

Run `install.sh`, follow instructions.

Note: this will append to your `~/.bashrc`.

Warning: never run scripts without checking them and being certain that they are not malicious.
